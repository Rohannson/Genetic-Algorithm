[Problem Description]
Subset sum problem is a typical NP-Complete problem which describes a situation that given a set of integers, does this set have a non-empty subset which can sum up to zero. This problem is an NP-complete problem which means it is easy to confirm whether the proposed answer is valid. However, initially, it is basically impossible to determine if there is any solution exists. 

Given a set {1, 7, 4, -5, -3}, the subset sum problem regarding to this set has a answer {1, 4, -5}. This might be an easy situation, if the size of a set is a lot bigger, the situation would not be this clear, and be prohibitively difficult to determine whether there is a solution to this set.
